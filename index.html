<ol>
<li>Artic fox</li>
<li>True fox</li>
<li>Crab-eating fox</li>
<li>Darwin's fox</li>
<li>red fox</li>
</ol>
<h2>Why you should love foxes</h2>
<p>Think about your favorite animal. What is it? A cat or dog or some type of fish? Even if it isnt
let me tell you why foxes are just <em><strong>better</strong></em>.<br> (I used "strong" to bolden the wors bettet, and em to "italizize" it)
<ul>
    <li>because I said so</li>
    <li>your favorite animal is probably ugly</li>
    <li>Dr suess said that my animal had cool socks</li>
    <li>Foxes are the representation of wisdom in the animal world</li>
</ul>
